KeyboardMetric is used for calculating keyboard interaction

It is asking for user to input interval time, and session time at the start of the program.

Just after users enters `start` it immediately tracks how fast use is typing, and which keys user typed the most.
- Click/s is visible all the time
- The most popular click is updated after every interval time, and at the end of the session, together with total clicks count

To run program `.\gradlew run` and result will appear in console/terminal
